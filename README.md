Uses Java Reflection to implement a bot that drops all items in the player's inventory.  Built for the open-source private server 2006scape.

Requires Java 8 and Intellij IDEA.  Before building, the client jar must be added as a module to the project.  The client jar included in the project is modified to always connect to local private server.  Alternative client options can be found (here)[https://github.com/2006-Scape/2006Scape]
